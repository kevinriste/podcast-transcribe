# Podcast transcription service

## Purpose

I created this in order to consume Substack subscriptions in the form of a podcast, because I'm much more effective at listening to podcasts than I am at reading emails.

## Explanation

The process.sh script is set up as a cron job. Every 20 minutes, it uses a Python script to  check the podcast-specific email account for new emails. If they exist, it downloads them locally.

Emails can be plain text newsletters, "link" emails (full article fetch), or "youtube" emails (audio download). Substack and Garbage Day emails are treated specially: a source URL is extracted from the email HTML, cleaned (Substack post URLs are reduced to `publication_id` + `post_id`), and stored in metadata.

RSS feeds are processed separately and also generate metadata (title/source/link). RSS "unread" state is tracked in `rss/feed-guids/`.

The next Python script checks the local directory for unprocessed emails. If they exist, it breaks the emails into chunks between 4000 and 5000 characters, stopping at the first whitespace to ensure the text-to-speech processing doesn't cut off individual words. The Google text-to-speech API has a limit of 5,000 characters at a time. Each chunk of the email is sent to Google for processing and an mp3 is returned in response. The mp3's are saved in order, and stitched together afterward. Once the stitching is confirmed successful, the file is moved to the podcast audio folder, and the email is removed from the local directory. There are safeguards for the maximum size of the email text to ensure that my Gooogle Cloud account isn't charged too much for any individual email, although a processing error of some kind could still cause issues since there isn't a full safeguard in place to shut down the account if too many characters are processed in a month. There is also a check to avoid processing empty emails. Some boilerplate Substack items are stripped out, as well as URL's, since they don't make for good podcast listening.

Each episode also gets a short summary (2-3 sentences) generated by GPT-5-mini. The summary is combined with the title and a source link in the description and written into ID3 tags so Dropcaster can include it in the RSS feed.

After this, a Docker container called dropcaster by nerab processes the audio files into a podcast feed. Every time this takes place, a hash is taken of the audio directory so that dropcaster only needs to run if the directory has changed.

Lastly, Docker cleanup is run since the dropcaster run leaves behind a new stopped container every single time.

There is also a second script that can run which uses the AWS Polly text-to-speech service. I have tried this out but I prefer the Google service. Others say that the Polly one is more natural-sounding. In order for the AWS script to work, AWS credentials need to be set at the ENV level on the machine running the script.

There is also a third script that can run which uses the OpenAI text-to-speech service. I am currently testing it out. Also requires environment variable credentials (OPENAI_API_KEY)

To keep the feed size stable, audio files older than 8 weeks are moved into `dropcaster-docker/audio-archive` on a weekly cutoff before Dropcaster runs.
